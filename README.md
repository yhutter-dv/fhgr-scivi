# Tennis Move Recognizer
The purpose of this project is to provide a model that can distinguish between different Tennis moves, henceforth the name `temovre` (Tennis Move Recognizer). The project was done in collaboration with the company Subsequent during the module Scientific Visuliazation @ FHGR.


## Jupyter Notebook
In order to explore the data in more depth we have created a Jupyter Notebook in order to run it do the following commands:
```bash
cd jupyter_notebooks
python -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate.sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=venv
jupyter notebook ./
```

Next a Browser Tab should open. Then you can select the Jupyter Notebook of your choice.

> Important: Please do not forget to select the installed `venv` as the kernel in order to utilize the installed virtual environment in the Jupyter Notebook.
